Project Overview :
This project focuses on classifying chronic diseases using machine learning techniques. The model predicts the presence of chronic diseases based on a dataset containing various health parameters. This was developed as a mini-project during my college coursework.

Features :
* Data preprocessing and visualization
* Chronic disease prediction using machine learning
* Custom dataset with disease_presence as the target variable
* Model evaluation and performance analysis

Technologies Used :
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
* Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)

Dataset :
The dataset used in this project consists of multiple health-related attributes. The target column is disease_presence, which indicates whether a chronic disease is present or not.

Future Enhancements :
* Improve model accuracy with deep learning approaches
* Implement a web-based UI for disease prediction
* Expand dataset for better generalization
